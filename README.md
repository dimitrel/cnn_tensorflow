## Image Classification with Convolutional neural networks in tensorflow.

This demo provides with an implementation of an image classification system with convolutional neural networks in tensorflow. 
The basic goal is to execute a series of experiments for various parameters of the network and explore their impact on classifier's performance. (e.g. number of layers, learning rate, dropout rate, etc)
