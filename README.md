## Image Classification with Convolutional neural networks in tensorflow.

This is a demo of the implementation of an image classification system with convolutional neural networks in tensorflow. 
The basic goal is to execute a series of experiments for various parameters of the network. (e.g number of layers, learning rate, dropout rate, etc)
